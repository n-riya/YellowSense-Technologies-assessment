<h4>Functional Requirements<h4><br/>

On opening the app, users should be presented with a bottom navigation UI with “Jobs” and “Bookmarks” as the sections.

The Jobs screen should fetch data from the above API in an infinite scroll approach. Show the title, location, salary and phone data in each card.

Clicking on a Job card should show more details related to it on another screen.

A user should be able to bookmark a Job and this will appear in the “Bookmarks” tab.

All bookmarked Jobs should be stored in a database for offline viewing.

Maintain appropriate states for loading, error, empty etc throughout the app.

UI/UX & library selection is entirely up-to you.

Once completed, push the code to your Github account with video reference and share the link for evaluation. 
Good Luck!
